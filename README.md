💡 How It Works
A nav element is fixed at the top of the screen and styled with partial transparency.

JavaScript listens for scroll events, and once a threshold is crossed, the navbar receives a .scrolled class that updates its style.

The highlighted menu item ("Books : Treasure of knowledge") is dynamically emphasized after scrolling.

CSS handles transitions and responsiveness without the need for JavaScript frameworks.

You can add a live demo link or a GIF/screenshot here to showcase the scrolling effect.
